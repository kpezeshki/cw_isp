DCraw data flow:

The first few thousand lines are used to set up constants and load in data from the RAW input file
iheight holds image height
iwidth holds image width
BAYER holds raw image data, is set when raw files are read

1. Raw image data read by per-camera classes
    a. Raw image data stored in BAYER
    b. Image height and width stored in height / width
5. colorcheck called if camera isn't supported by a .dng file
    a. writes to matrix cut with colorchecker square coordinates
6. Foveon images handled (not super relevant to us)
7. pre-interpolate called
    a. Reads from BAYER array, writes to img matrix
8. lin_interpolate called
    a. Reads from BAYER array, writes to img matrix
9. convert_to_rgb called
    a. calls gamma_curve
        i. writes to array curve
    b. calls FC, which returns matrix values from a predefined matrix
    c. calls CLIP, which restricts an integer to 16 bits
    a. calls pseudoinverse
        i.  calculates the inverse of a matrix and returns a pointer to the address of the result
    b. writes to img
